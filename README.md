# mauryaratan/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

I do a lot of WordPress and like to talk about it. I'm always in learning mode and ready to share it with everyone, just because I love talking and discussing about WordPress things. SO if you have any questions about WordPress or anything related to it; I'd be happy to have discuss it with you.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/mauryaratan/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/mauryaratan/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
